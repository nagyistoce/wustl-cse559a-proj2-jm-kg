<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
For this project, we compared various techniques for face recognition.  We focused our efforts on Principal Component Analysis and Mean Face comparison.  We experimented using different pre-processing techniques before performing PCA as well as testing different measures of similarity and modifying the value of <i>k</i> in k-Nearest Neighbor.</p>

<p>We used k-Nearest Neighbor to attempt to match a face with the subject it most closely related to.  kNN works by finding the neighbors that are "closest" to a test image and picking the neighbor that is most frequent as its best match.  The value of <i>k</i> determines how many neighbors will be analyzed when trying to pick a match.  In order for kNN to work, a measure of similarity between the test image and all training images needs to be computed.  These results are then sorted and the top <i>k</i> neighbors are chosen.  The neighbors in our algorithm are the list of images that were the closest match to the test image. Because each person has multiple images for them, we determine which person showed up most frequently, and say that is who the test image most closely matches.</p>

<p>We tried four different measures of similarity before using its results to find the nearest neighbor. The similarity measures we tried using were:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Euclidean Distance (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">info</a>)<br/><br/>

	Euclidean Distance (ED) performed the best compared to the other measures of similarity that we experimented with.
	<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Normalized Euclidean Distance (<a href="http://www.tsi.enst.fr/tsi/enseignement/ressources/mti/classif-textures/node4.html">info</a>)<br/><br/>
	Normalized Euclidean Distance (NED) performed exactly the same as ED did in all of our experiments.
	<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Cosine Similarity (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">info</a>)<br/><br/>
	Cosine (CS) performed poorly in all of our experiments.  It's results are not shown in any of our tables below because it's results are not worth showing.  It performed better than chance, but only marginally.  It was not a good measure of similarity here.  This is not surprising as CS tends to be the preferred technique for comparing text and not faces or coefficients from PCA.
	<br/><br/></li>

	<li>Mahalanobis Distance (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance">info</a>)<br/><br/>
	Mahalanobis Distance (MD) performed extremely badly.  It performed as good as chance, but no better.  It's possible we implemented MD incorrectly or that MD really is just not a good measure of similarity for comparing coefficients.</li>

<h3>Extension 1 Description</h3>

<p>We extended the base option to work with another data set of faces; specifically, the 40-person subset of "aligned labelled faces in the wild".  We tested this data by using the full set of images as training data (with different numbers of images per person), and also by limiting the training data to 18 randomly selected images per person (such that each person has equal representation in the training data).</p>
<p>For each of these training data options, we tried using full images (but resampled to half-size, due to computer memory constraints), and using only the face portion of the image (the 70x100 center rectangle).  Using the full images produced very poor results in all tests, so that data is not shown.  This is probably because much of the background portions of the images were evaluated in the matching, which contributes to erroneous results.  Using only the central face portion of the image produced much better results, but still markedly worse than that for the more homogeneous data set in the base option.  In fact, the best results are significantly less than half correct.  The poor results are probably due to the fact that the images vary so much more than the ones from base option.  Even with only the face portion shown, the lighting conditions are still greatly varying compared to that of base option, resulting in poor matching.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, limiting the data set to an equal number of images per person yielded slightly worse results.  This seems to indicate that having more images for some people does not necessarily cause erroneous matches to gravitate toward them.  Rather, limiting the diversity of the training set images probably contributes to worse matches.</p>

<h3>Extension 2 Description</h3>
<p><del>(general observations, histogram equalization helped achieve better results when using more coefficients, but decreased results in all other cases.  edge detection pretty much sucked and did worse than if we had just not used it.  histogram equalization with edge map overlaid performed better than no preprocessing, but worse than just histo eq.  obviously, edge detection brings down the results.  probably because information is being lost from the image.  we also tried blurring the image, but this also performed poorly, about as good as edge detection.  Likely for the same reason edge detection did bad.</del></p>
